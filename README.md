**ISO 27001 Controls to Reality**
This repository transforms ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls from theoretical requirements into practical, real-world implementations. While most resources focus on what the standard says, this project focuses on how organisations can actually implement, evidence, automate, and operationalise each control in environments like Microsoft 365, Azure, Windows, and typical corporate networks.

Each Annex A control group contains guides, templates, examples, and configuration notes that help bridge the gap between governance-level requirements and technical enforcement. Whether you're a consultant, security engineer, or internal auditor, you will find actionable guidance here.

Mappings to NIST CSF, CIS Controls, and cloud shared-responsibility models are also included to support framework consolidation and compliance reporting. Contributions are encouraged — especially real-world implementations, diagrams, scripts, and checklists.
